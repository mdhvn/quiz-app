# Exun 2015 Quiz Prelims

Quiz conduction app, built for and used successfully at <a href="http://www.exunclan.com" target="_blank">Exun 2015</a> - to help conduct <em>paper-less</em> preliminary rounds of the Junior and Senior Quiz events. 
<br>Includes : 
<ul>
  <li>Building the quiz by the administrator(s)</li>
  <li>Attempting by users </li>
  <li>Grading by admin(s) </li>
  <li>Real-time display of the result</li>
</ul>

Built using PHP, MySQL, help from the wonderful folks over at Stack Overflow and the powerful C9 IDE.

First attempt at building a web app that does something. 

Fairly easily to replicate - so feel free to use this to conduct events of a similar nature.
